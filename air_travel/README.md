These scripts are designed to do the following--

1. Convert a set of DoT-RITA monthly flight csvs into a single dataframe

2. Import and merge a set of supplementary files detailing flight & passenger information for each airline by month.

3. Merge and crunch the datasets above to estimate passengers-per-flight for every flight, as well as some other business intelligence regarding Thanksgiving air travel.

4. Create a Shiny dashboard visualizing Thanksgiving air travel over time on a world map.
