# Assorted scripts

This folder is a catch-all for various projects I've worked on.  Many of these are older projects and largely for historical record-keeping. Although I generally stand by the final results, these are not representative of my current approaches to coding.

## Contents

* A visualization of botnet activity.

* A script to produce a concordance for the text of the novel "Gravity's Rainbow" from a text file.

* A script to project elementary-age population in the United States through the year 2038. 

* An algorithm to correct errant article usage in the English language.

* A project to determine Thanksgiving air travel patterns over the past 14 years, in contrast to non-holiday travel patterns.
